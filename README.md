# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with PyTorch

## Project Overview
This repository contains a deep learning project developed for a course at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), conducted from March to April 2024. The project involves designing and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model employs a combination of attention-weighted convolutional layers, intermediate blocks, and state-of-the-art techniques such as data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout. The project achieved a predicted distinction with a peak testing accuracy of 86.12%.

## Features
- **Attention-Weighted Convolutional Layers:** Enhances model sensitivity to salient features in the image data.
- **Advanced Data Augmentation:** Increases the diversity of the training data, improving model robustness.
- **Batch Normalization and Dropout:** Stabilizes the learning process and helps in preventing overfitting.
- **Adaptive Optimizers and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes the training process for maximum accuracy.
